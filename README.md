# SMS Fix Magisk Module for Samsung Galaxy A15 4G / 5G

A Magisk module that fixes incoming SMS on Galaxy A15 4G/ 5G by rolling back the RIL libraries to those from firmware `A536BOXM7CWF6` (start of July 2023).

**⚠️ Do not install this module if you don't have problems receiving texts, or if you are on firmware `A536BOXM7CWF6` or earlier.**

## Installation
Download the [latest version](https://github.com/mylove90/a15xx-ril-rollback/releases/latest) and flash it on the Magisk app or a custom recovery.
